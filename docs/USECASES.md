# Use Cases — agent-kanban

How the kanban gets used in practice. Each UC is a short scenario: who acts,
what they do, what they get back. Only what the system actually supports
today — no "future features".

## Task lifecycle

```
                user                                       agent (Claude/Cline/...)
                 ↓                                                ↓
   ┌────────┐  push  ┌──────────┐  pull  ┌──────────┐  ────→  ┌────────────┐
   │ Backlog│ ─────→ │ Approved │ ─────  │ Analyst  │         │ In progress│
   └────────┘        └──────────┘        └──────────┘         └────────────┘
                                                                    │
                                                                    ↓
   ┌────────┐  ←──── ┌──────────┐  ←──── ┌────────────┐
   │  Done  │ accept │   UAT    │  done  │  Testing   │
   └────────┘        └──────────┘        └────────────┘

   Blocked — a parallel column for anything that's stuck.
   Cancelled — terminal state for "we're not doing this".
```

Column "owners" (see `kanban_columns()`) are a **semantic hint**, not access
control. The UI and API let you move a card anywhere. Columns can be edited
in `kanban_store/store.py` (`STATUSES` + `status_meta()`).

## UC-0: First-time setup

**Who:** new user who just cloned the repo.

**Steps:**
1. `git clone … && cd agent-kanban`
2. `python3.12 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `.venv/bin/python -m kanban_ui` → http://localhost:7777
4. They see the **`default` project** with an empty board, 9 columns, sidebar on the left, and a `+ Task` button in the topbar.

**Outcome:** runs locally, DB in `tasks.db`, no accounts, no cloud.

Optional: `bash scripts/install_launchd.sh install` — auto-start on login.

---

## UC-1: Solo developer with Claude Code

**Who:** one person, with Claude Code open in some project.

**Trigger:** I want the agent to see my tasks and move cards as work progresses.

**Steps:**
1. Create a project in the kanban (`+ New project` → name + slug + directory = current repo).
2. Drop a `.mcp.json` at the repo root:
   ```jsonc
   { "mcpServers": { "agent-kanban": {
       "type": "stdio",
       "command": "/abs/.venv/bin/python",
       "args": ["-m", "kanban_mcp"],
       "cwd":  "/abs/agent-kanban",
       "env":  { "KANBAN_PROJECT_ID": "myproj" }
   }}}
   ```
3. Restart Claude Code (`/mcp restart agent-kanban`).
4. In chat: *"show me what I'm working on"* → the agent calls `kanban_my_active(assignee="claude", project_id="myproj")`.

**Outcome:** the agent knows the context — it can `kanban_pull` a task from Approved, drop `kanban_comment` notes as it works, and finally `kanban_move(task_id, "testing")`.

---

## UC-2: Team channel in Slack/Telegram

**Who:** a team of 2-5 people who want chat notifications when something moves.

**Steps:**
1. Get a Slack incoming webhook URL, or `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage?chat_id=<CHAT>` for Telegram.
2. Create `kanban_data/webhooks.json`:
   ```json
   { "webhooks": [
     { "name": "Slack #dev", "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/...",
       "events": ["task_moved", "task_created"], "format": "slack" }
   ]}
   ```
3. No restarts needed — hot-reload by mtime.

**Outcome:** when `task_moved` fires, the chat gets `→ [Project] T-123 «Title»: backlog → in_progress — comment`. Delivery is fire-and-forget, the main HTTP request isn't blocked. Delivery logs at `/api/automation/status.webhooks`.

---

## UC-3: Importing existing project (legacy `PROJECT-PLAN.md`)

**Who:** a user who already has markdown plans in a repo.

**Trigger:** I want to wire those files into the board without rewriting them by hand.

**Steps:**
1. `+ New project` → ID slug + directory → click "Choose…" → native Finder.
2. Under the **"Existing plans"** tab the kanban scans files in the directory and shows candidates by priority (`PROJECT-PLAN.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `TODO.md` first). Plan files (priority ≤ 5) are pre-checked.
3. Click "Save".

**What happens:**
- The parser reads each file and walks `## ...` sections:
  - Canonical headings (`## Backlog`, `## Done`, `## Бэклог`) → tasks land in the matching column
  - Anything else (`## 🔴 Tier 0`, `## v2 stages`) → goes into `backlog` with the section name copied into `description` for context
- Cards are created idempotently (uniqueness on `project_id + title`)
- Appends an instruction block to `CLAUDE.md` so Claude in that folder knows new tasks should be written into the plan file

**Outcome:** a project with 183 tasks in one second, no copy-paste.

---

## UC-4: Daily standup in 30 seconds

**Who:** you in the morning, with Claude Code open.

**Steps:**
1. *"What am I working on right now?"* → `kanban_my_active(assignee="claude")`
2. *"Anything stuck?"* → `kanban_list(status="blocked")`
3. *"What's the priority in the backlog?"* → `kanban_list(status="backlog")` + the client filters `priority=high`

**Outcome:** plan for the day, no browser needed.

UI alternative: `/p/myproj` → HIGH filter → density compact → everything visible at a glance.

---

## UC-5: Full agent session on a single task

**Who:** Claude Code session, you say "take T-008 and ship it".

**Flow:**
1. `kanban_get("T-008")` — reads description + acceptance + history.
2. `kanban_pull("T-008")` — atomically `approved → analyst, assignee=claude`.
3. *(code analysis, plan)* → `kanban_comment("T-008", "Plan: ...")`.
4. `kanban_move("T-008", "in_progress", comment="started writing the parser")`.
5. *(work)* → `kanban_link("T-008", "pr", "https://github.com/.../pull/42")`.
6. `kanban_move("T-008", "testing", comment="code+tests ready")` — webhook fires into Slack.
7. In the UI you see the card in Testing, you review → drag-drop into **UAT** → **Done**.

**Outcome:** the task ran the full workflow; history holds every step with the actor (`claude`), PR links, and comments.

---

## UC-6: Auto-archive old tasks

**Who:** user whose board is cluttered with done cards.

**Steps:** in `kanban_data/rules.json`:
```json
{ "rules": [{
  "name": "Archive done cards after 30 days",
  "trigger": { "type": "task_idle", "status": "done", "days": 30 },
  "action":  { "type": "archive", "comment": "Auto-archive" }
}]}
```

**Outcome:** every 60 seconds (`KANBAN_AUTOMATION_INTERVAL`) the engine checks the rules. Archived cards disappear from the board but stay `done` — counts and history keep telling the truth (`· N archived` in the top bar shows them again). A polling rule acts on a task **once per stay in the column**; add `"repeat_every": {"hours": 24}` for a daily reminder. All actions land in history with `actor=automation`.

Supported triggers: `task_idle` (by `moved_at`; `days`/`hours`/`minutes`), `task_count_in_status` (gt/lt), `blockers_done` (every internal blocker is done/cancelled), `task_moved` (reactive).
Supported actions: `move_to`, `add_comment`, `set_priority`, `assign`, `archive`, `run_command`.

Don't use `move_to cancelled` for archiving: `cancelled` means "won't do", and done work relabelled that way makes the board say nothing was ever finished. Databases that already did this can be fixed with `python -m kanban_store.maintenance restore-archived --apply`.

---

## UC-7: Inbox capture (ad-hoc notes)

**Who:** I'm working and an idea pops up.

**Steps:**
- Write `~/Projects/agent-kanban/kanban_data/inbox/quick-note.md`:
  ```markdown
  ---
  title: "Pin" button for important tasks
  priority: low
  size: S
  ---
  Pins the card to the top of its column.
  ```
- Within 5 seconds the card appears in the backlog. The file is moved to `inbox/processed/2026-05-09/quick-note.md`.

You can point the watcher at any folder via `KANBAN_INBOX_DIR`. For example, `~/.claude/projects/<encoded>/memory/inbox/` — Claude drops session summaries there and the kanban picks them up.

---

## UC-8: Multiple Claude Code projects at once

**Who:** I jump between 3 projects in different directories during the day.

**Steps:**
1. Each repo gets its own `.mcp.json` with `KANBAN_PROJECT_ID="<slug-of-this-project>"`.
2. When I'm in `~/code/myapp`, Claude only sees and moves `myapp` tasks.
3. In the UI: `Cmd+Shift+R` → URL `/p/myapp` or click in the sidebar.

**Outcome:** contexts don't bleed into each other; per-project history stays isolated.

The UI sidebar remembers the last-opened project (`localStorage.kb.lastProject`) — wherever you were last is where you land.

---

## UC-9: Browser-only workflow (no AI)

**Who:** I don't use an AI agent, or I use a separate web chat.

**Steps:**
- `+ Task` or `n` to create.
- Drag-drop cards across columns.
- Mouse wheel on empty space → horizontal pan across the board.
- Hover a column → `+` for quick-add (single-line title, Enter to create).
- Click a card → modal with history, links, blockers, comments.
- Search (`/`), filter chips (HIGH / Blocker / Agents / Free).
- Density toggle (`d`) for tight mode at 100+ tasks.

**Outcome:** the kanban is no different from Trello/Jira — just local and account-free.

---

## UC-11: Auto-launch agent on Approved

**Who:** solo dev who drags a task from Backlog to Approved and wants the agent to take it from there.

**Trigger:** drag-drop in the UI, or `POST /api/tasks/{id}/move` → `to_status="approved"`.

**Setup:**

1. **Bind the kanban project to the Claude Code project directory** (UI → `⋯` → "Project directory"). That directory needs an `.mcp.json` connecting to agent-kanban (see [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md#1-claude-code-mcp)).

2. **Wire up the bundled launcher** — `examples/agent-launcher/launch-claude.sh`. Make it executable (`chmod +x`).

3. **Add a rule in `kanban_data/rules.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "rules": [{
       "name": "Auto-claim approved tasks",
       "enabled": true,
       "trigger": {
         "type": "task_moved",
         "to_status": "approved",
         "project_id": "myproj"
       },
       "action": {
         "type": "run_command",
         "cmd": "/abs/path/to/agent-kanban/examples/agent-launcher/launch-claude.sh",
         "args": ["{task_id}", "{project_id}"],
         "log_file": "~/Library/Logs/agent-kanban/launcher.log",
         "max_concurrent": 1,
         "max_runs": 3
       }
     }]
   }
   ```

   Hot-reload by mtime — no restart needed.

**What happens on drag-drop into Approved:**

1. UI, REST, an MCP agent or a script → `move_task(T-027, to_status="approved")` → a row in `task_history`.
2. The server's event feed sees the row (within ~1 s, whoever wrote it) → the rule engine matches and starts `launch-claude.sh T-027 myproj`. A card *created* directly in Approved counts too.
3. The launcher checks the card, the `claude` binary and the login, then runs `claude -p` in the project directory with an explicit `--mcp-config`, `--permission-mode dontAsk` and a timeout. It stays in the foreground while the agent works; the card shows a `▶ agent` chip.
4. Through MCP, Claude calls `kanban_pull(T-027)` (approved → analyst, assignee=claude), posts a plan via `kanban_comment`, moves to `in_progress`, implements, and finally `kanban_move(T-027, "testing", comment="what was done, how it was verified")`.
5. If the agent exits and leaves the card behind (crash, timeout, missing login), the launcher moves it to **Blocked** with the reason and the log path.
6. In the UI you see the card in Testing, you review → drag into **UAT** → **Done**.

**Triggers (rule.trigger.type=task_moved):**
- `to_status` (required) — destination column.
- `from_status` (optional) — source column. If set, it filters (a created card has none).
- `project_id` (optional) — one slug or a list of slugs.

**Action `run_command`:**
- `cmd` — path to an executable (on the server).
- `args` — list with placeholders: `{task_id}`, `{title}`, `{project_id}`, `{status}`, `{from_status}`, `{to_status}`.
- `env` (optional) — extra environment variables.
- `log_file` (optional) — stdout/stderr go there; by default to `kanban_data/logs/<rule>.log`.
- `max_concurrent` (optional) — at most N processes of this rule at once; the rest wait in a queue.
- `max_runs` (optional) — after N launches for the same card, block it instead of launching again (moving it out of Blocked resets the count). Exit code 75 is not counted.

One process per card and rule at a time: a second trigger while the first launch is alive is ignored. Processes start in their own session, so restarting the kanban does not kill running agents. `POST /api/automation/pause` (or the ⏸ button) stops all rules at once.

**Security note:** `cmd` and `args` execute on the server with no sandboxing. Keep the script yours, and don't pull webhook payloads from untrusted sources into it.

**Your own agent instead of Claude Code:** copy `launch-claude.sh` → `launch-myagent.sh`, replace `claude -p` with your CLI (`opencode`, `aider`, an OpenAI SDK wrapper). Same contract: fetch the task over REST, run the agent in the foreground, leave the card in a truthful column (and say why in a comment) before exiting.

---

## UC-10: Snapshot for reporting

**Who:** end of the week, you need to show what got done.

**Steps:**
- `Snapshot` button in the topbar, or `POST /api/snapshot`.
- `snapshots/2026-05-09.json` now holds a full JSON dump: every project + every task + history.

**Outcome:** an artifact you can commit, send, or analyze.

Snapshots are gitignored by default (see `.gitignore`); flip the rule if you want them versioned.

---

## What's **not** in the current scope

- Multi-user auth — the kanban listens on `127.0.0.1` only. If you want a team, run nginx with basic-auth or Authelia in front, or wait for the Roadmap "multi-user mode".
- `PLAN.md` sync — importing a plan file is a one-shot action when you connect it; later edits to the file do not reach the board, and UI edits are not written back. Agents file new tasks with `kanban_create`.
- Sub-tasks / hierarchy — `task_blockers` covers dependencies (DAG), but there's no real nesting.
- Time tracking — `moved_at` and `created_at` exist in history; aggregate on top yourself via `/api/snapshot`.
- GitHub Issues sync — `project_source.git` stores a URL+token, but issue import isn't implemented yet.
